        <h1>Programming</h1>
        <h4>The Big Three: Java, C++, and JavaScript</h4>
        <br>
        <p>I have used three programming languages extensively in my education and career so far:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Java</li>
          <p>Java is where it all began. In high school I took an AP Computer Science course as my introduction to programming and picked up Java as my first language. Since then, I have used it extensively in several collegiate courses, namely Data Structures and Algorithms. It was in Java that I first implemented linked lists, stacks, queues, and learned about sorting. Since then, I have used Java to implement networking protocols with socket programming, and discover the asymptotic run time complexity of almost any given algorithm using the Master Theorem.</p>
          <a href='projects#network'>Things I've written in Java</a></br></br>
          <li>C++</li>
          <p>I started working with C++ in the summer of 2013, creating a standalone graphical user interface for telecommunications software in a research lab at UTD. I used Qt4 to create a desktop application that allowed a user to easily manipulate configuration files. Through learning C++, I gained exposure to Unix operating systems, file manipulation, database management, and version control.</p>
          <!-- <a href='#'>Things I've written in C++</a></br></br> -->
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <p>Recently, I have begun using JavaScript in several different ways.<ul><li>I have used it to customize the behavior of a Customer Relationship Software called Netsuite, modifying customer and partner records, setting up user event field changes, and creating scripted reports and updates touching hundreds of thousands of transaction records.</li><li>I have employed the Node.js runtime environment to act as a middle man between Netsuite and Shopify, updating data as it changes in the form of a cron task. </li><li>Finally, I have created web applications and web sites such as this one with Node.js, Express, and Mongo to perform various tasks, including acting as a reporting system and bundle management system so ecommerce giant Shopify can behave as a custom inventory management system.</li></ul></p>
          <a href='projects#heatmap'>Things I've written in JavaScript</a></br></br>
        </ol>
        <p>However, I firmly believe that programming languages are merely tools to solve critical thinking problems. It is not my grasp of C++, for example, that is valuable, it is my underlying understanding of Computer Science and problem solving that matters. </p>

      <h3>Digital Design</h3>
      <p>The degree I am pursuing, Computer Engineering, is an intermixing of hardware and software, for example in the field of embedded systems. Through my coursework at UTD, I have become familiar with the Xilinx ISE design suite in my digital design classes.<br><br>With a team of students, I programmed an FPGA board to behave as a microprocessor from the ground up, complete with an Arithmetic Logic Unit, RAM, and ROM. To do this, I used basic gates to build flip flops and registers, wrote my own instruction set to perform basic arithmetic operations, and then displayed the result to a seven-segment display.<br></p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
      <p>I am familiar with any version of Windows ranging from XP to 10. However, much of my development work has been done on OS X and Linux machines. Distros that I have worked on include Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS. I’m no sysadmin, but I am more than comfortable using the command line for everyday tasks and software development alike.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h3>Networking</h3>
      <p>After taking a Computer Networks course at the University of Texas at Dallas, I have been exposed to IPv4 addressing and subnets, DHCP, NAT, ICMP, Link-state routing (Dijkstra’s algorithm), Distance vector routing (Bellman-Ford algorithm), multicasting, multiple access protocols, different Quality of Service models, and cryptography concepts.</p>

      <h3>More</h3>
      <p>My homelab setup consists of two Windows machines, three rackmount servers running Debian 7.8, three headless towers running Ubuntu 15.04, a Raspberry Pi B+, and a 15Tb NAS running Ubuntu 14.04. On these machines I run TeamSpeak servers, render Minecraft scenes, and host various video games I play with my friends and roommates. My preferred text editor is Sublime, but I am flexible.</p>
